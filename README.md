## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
      I am Sam Ervin a software engineer, manager, and project manager. I have been responsible for leadership and technical expertise in software engineering with a few different companies using many different systems architectures, hardware platforms, operating systems, frameworks, and programming languages throughout my career journey. I like all things .NET, tech gadgets, robotics, woodworking, sailing, boats and programming languages.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few Next.js personal and professional things. One is my personal site, testing out a blog site I found and the other is development on an Openstack Cloud Client UI called Sunrise. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on Next.js
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about .NET and Java or the secret to a happy dog. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: samuel.ervin@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once helped unload a Panda at FedEx from a plane when I worked there in College.
